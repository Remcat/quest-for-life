%p This site started as one of Steven's favorite astronomy lectures. The International Year of Astronomy seemed like a good time to take this presentation and move it to the web for everyone to see, but it took three willing friends and a <a href="http://railsrumble.com">Rails Rumble</a> competition to bring this to fruition.
