      %p Has our civilization been around for 6,000 years (Ancient Egypt)? 200 years (the birth of America)? That's a big difference and it matters to the end result. The real point of interest is the discovery of radio. That marks a technological level sufficient to communicate. For us, that is about 100 years. So far&hellip;

    %dd.detail
      %p Great civilizations have collapsed many times in hour history. But for <em>human civilization</em> as a whole, these have only been setbacks. We may lose some culture or technology, but it always comes back and gets even more advanced in the next rise to power.
      %p A similar setback in the future would not be the end of our ability to communicate. The end is really the extinction, or near extinction, of <i>Homo sapiens</i> as a species &mdash; losses sufficient to halt the transmission of culture from one generation to the next. How long until that happens?
